# Guardian Developer Tools

## Usage
First, add the tap:

```bash
brew tap guardian/homebrew-devtools
```

Then, install the [casks](./Casks) and [formulae](./Formula).

At a minimum, you should install `gu-base`:

```bash
brew install gu-base
```

## What is it?
A collection of core developer tools used at the Guardian, 
wrapped up in a [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) [tap](https://docs.brew.sh/How-to-Create-and-Maintain-a-Tap).

There are numerous [casks](./Casks) and [formulae](./Formula) available.

## What is it not?
An opinionated list of tools or apps.

There are many ways to manage Node (`nvm`, `fnm`, `asdf`, etc.) or Java (`coursier`, `sdkman`, `asdf` etc.).
Similarly, there multiple browsers one can use (Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera, etc.).

For this reason, rather than being prescriptive, we leave the choice up to the user.

ðŸ’¡ It is recommended to install applications using `brew` as you can then create a `Brewfile` that can be checked into VCS, making it easier to set up a new machine.
More information about this can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/ChristopherA/a579274536aab36ea9966f301ff14f3f).

For example, to install IntelliJ, VS Code and Google Chrome, one can do:

```bash
brew install --cask intellij-idea
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
brew install --cask google-chrome
```
